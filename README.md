# catalystforensics.io
IT485 Final Project

I created this simple site for my IT project last semester. The website is essentially a starup that sells computer forensics tools. A downloadable python script is available as well if you want to use fully test the website. This python script is used to detect suspicious packets on your network and it also visualizes this data. It works almost exactly like wireshark. Also, the program automatically uploads your data to the website using php. I sadly did not get the chance to add an encrypted database due to time constraints. Requiremnets to run the program successfully are avaliable in "get_started.html" file.

CSS files are included as well. The CSS & JS are both already implimented in the HTML files in case you want to open a file directly in your browser. JS files are not included becasue there was not much javascript used besides icons, animations, etc.
